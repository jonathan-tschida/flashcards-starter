# Flash Cards Solo Project
by Jonathan Tschida

## Abstract
This is a solo project assigned during Mod 2 at Turing.  We were provided with some basic set up files and asked to create an app that presents the user with flashcards to answer via the command line. The goal of the project was to make us more familiar with TDD (Test Driven Development) as well as OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
